# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MangaDx URL parsing system fails to recognize valid MangaDx chapter URLs that include page numbers or other URL parameters. Users are getting "Unsupported URL" errors when trying to use legitimate MangaDx chapter URLs like `https://mangadx.org/chapter/71521b4a-964c-466e-987a-14e2653f1cd0/1`. This feature will improve URL parsing to handle various MangaDx URL formats and provide better error messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a manga reader, I want to paste any valid MangaDx chapter URL (with or without page numbers) so that I can easily access manga chapters without having to modify the URL format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a MangaDx URL with page number suffix (e.g., `/1`, `/2`) THEN the system SHALL extract the chapter ID and load the chapter successfully
2. WHEN a user enters a MangaDx URL with query parameters THEN the system SHALL ignore the parameters and extract the chapter ID
3. WHEN a user enters a MangaDx URL with both page number and query parameters THEN the system SHALL handle both and extract the chapter ID
4. WHEN a user enters a standard MangaDx chapter URL without suffixes THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a manga reader, I want to receive clear error messages when I enter an invalid URL so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an invalid MangaDx URL format THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the expected MangaDx URL format
2. WHEN a user enters a URL from an unsupported manga source THEN the system SHALL list all supported sources with example URL formats
3. WHEN a MangaDx chapter ID is invalid or not found THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message distinguishing between URL format issues and chapter availability issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust URL validation and parsing so that the system can handle various URL formats from supported manga sources reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a manga URL THEN it SHALL validate the URL format before attempting to extract chapter information
2. WHEN the system encounters a malformed URL THEN it SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
3. WHEN the system successfully parses a URL THEN it SHALL normalize the extracted data for consistent processing
4. IF a URL contains special characters or encoding THEN the system SHALL handle URL decoding properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a manga reader, I want the system to be flexible with URL formats so that I can copy-paste URLs directly from my browser without worrying about exact formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a URL with trailing slashes THEN the system SHALL handle it correctly
2. WHEN a user enters a URL with mixed case domain names THEN the system SHALL process it case-insensitively
3. WHEN a user enters a URL with `http://` instead of `https://` THEN the system SHALL accept both protocols
4. WHEN a user enters a URL with extra whitespace THEN the system SHALL trim and process it correctly
